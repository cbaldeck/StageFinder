# StageFinder

I created a website to recommend venues to bands based on their desired location, musical style, and fanbase.  The project was created using python with data from listenersâ€™ last.fm playlists as well as concert data scraped from songkick.  I used last.fm playlist data to determine the similarity among musical groups, and combined this similarity with concert history data (who has played at what venues) in a collaborative filtering model to create the recommendations.  I also geolocated the venues in order to provide recommendations which are restricted to a given geographic area.
